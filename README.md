# Free and open source and licesned under the GPL 3 license 

the best part about this script is it can be developed and maintained for years and years 

with out breaking or anything 

and you are free to do what ever and work on it


# To use this script

all you have to do is type 

chmod +x where.sh 

and then run the script like this
